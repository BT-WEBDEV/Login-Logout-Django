# Login-Logout-Django

Case Use: Simple login/logout project using Django that can be utilized for additional future projects. Login/logout is a staple of web applications, so its important to utilize this. This code could be used to bootstrap a future application. 

PLEASE READ THIS FIRST - To utilize this code, you will need to use Django along with Python. 

1. - Once Django is installed, you will need to create a New Project to intialize the proper folders/files in order for it to run. Please utilize the Django documentation in order to do this. 

2. -  Once a New Project folder is created, feel free to use the folders/files available from this reposititory and copy them into your project folder. A new user will need to create a new "superuser" in order to access the ADMIN backend of the Django application. Again, reference Django documentation to learn more. 

3. - To test on your local machine you will need to run the "manage.py" script with "runserver". This will let you test locally within your browser at "localhost:8000" or your default location.
